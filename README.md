# Gravie Software Engineer Challenge

## Instructions

After completing the challenge below, please send us an email with the location of your repository. If
your repository is private, be sure to add us as collaborators so we can view your code.

### Time Box

3-4 Hours

## Synopsis

For this challenge you will implement the Giant Bomb API to create an application that will allow a
user to search games and "rent" them. The application should consist of at least two unique pages
(`search` and `checkout`). Your view should display the game thumbnail and title, and the rest is up
to you. You can use any language and or framework you'd like.
